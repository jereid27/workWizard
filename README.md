# WORK WIZARD - Employee Dashboard

### About this project:
Work Wizard - Employee Dashboard is a fullstack application built using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Boot Security, HTML, CSS, and
PostgreSQL designed to help independent contractors such as cosmetologists and tattoo artists manage their
pay log, consultation notes, and inventory. The user can safely create and log into their own account and manage specific details
about their business with CRUD functionality. A generative report for payment history can be made and viewed based on the information
entered by the user.

### Why this project?
I have spent my professional career working as an independent contractor with many processes such as consultation notes, inventory checks, and income logs that
could and should be automated to ensure a successful work-flow. I built Work Wizard as way to automate these processes for my own sake, and hopefully help automate my
coworkers work-load as well.

### Things I hope to improve in the future: 

While this project functions exactly as intended, I hope to make it more user-friendly and
available on mobile devices. I also hope to update the security by implementing admin roles.
